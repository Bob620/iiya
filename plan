Every song, album, and artist needs to be identified via api, easiest way is a id of some sort

possible ids: 
- Hash (artist name/album title/song title or file)
- uuid (Everything is assigned a uuid upon being added)

best id:
- Everything gets it's own uuid upon being added
- Songs, albums, and artists are checked for duplicates in the library based on their name/title, if found assumed to be the same
- Allowed to change the links between songs/albums/artists

----------

Artists:
- Only one artist with any given name, all songs/albums with the same artist name will be attributed to that single artist
- Songs and albums attributed to the same artist get combined under that one artist

Albums:
- Unlimited albums with the same name, unique album names per artist
- Albums with the same name and artist get combined
- Albums can have more then one artist, album will be merged, keeping all artists on the album

Songs:
- Unlimited songs with the same name, unique song names per artist
- Songs with the same name and artist will be a special menu (Assumed the same song, all files kept for manual change)
- If a song is by 2 or more artists, and one artist already has that song(name)... both artists will have the "master" song

----------

Search:
- Can search generally for any song/album/artist that fits the terms given
- Can search specifically for a song, album, or artist that fits the terms given
- Can search for the specific name of a song, album, or artist and return only the exact match
  - Allows for adding in new songs/albums/artists or combining them togeather

----------

- Adding new artist, albums, and songs must be synchronous
- Seraches are asynchronous, finds are synchronous
- Artists are the main entry point into the system, they require nothing to be attached to them to function correctly
- Albums require artists but not songs
- Songs require artists but not albums
